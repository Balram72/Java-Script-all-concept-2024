    control structure:
    it is used to control our program.
    it is used to control the flow of the program.
    we also used to move the flow one line to another line
        control structure Type:
            1. conditional control structure
            2. selecation control structure 
            3. jump control structure 
            4. loop control structure

              1. conditional control structure
                    -> it work on the condication
                    -> if the condication is true then if block will excute other wise else block will excute.
                    -> if ,else,else if, nexted if, if else lander
                    -> if else lander  -> multipal use if else
              syntax:-
                  if(condication){
                  }else{
                  } 
              2.selecation control structure
