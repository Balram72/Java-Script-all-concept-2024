    control structure:
    it is used to control our program.
    it is used to control the flow of the program.
    we also used to move the flow one line to another line
        control structure Type:
            1. conditional control structure
            2. selecation control structure 
            3. jump control structure 
            4. loop control structure

              1. conditional control structure
                    -> it work on the condication
                    -> if the condication is true then if block will excute other wise else block will excute.
                    -> if ,else,else if, nexted if, if else lander
                    -> if else lander  -> multipal use if else
              syntax:-
                  if(condication){
                  }else{
                  } 
              2.selecation control structure
                 -> swetch case(....)            
                 -> case can be type of variable
                 -> Break number flow the program 
              3. loop control structure
                 -> for,while,do...while,foreach,for...of,for...in
                    -> for 
                        ->it is an entry control loof
                        ->it will check the condication at entry time.
                    -> while
                        ->this is also know as entry control loop
                    -> do...while
                        -> This is are exit cotrol loop
                        ->when we the loop while execute for 1 time this loop will suitable.
                        ->it will excuted 1 time even the condication will flase
